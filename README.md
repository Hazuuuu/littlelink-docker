# LittleLink (Docker version)

This project is a fork of [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink). I wanted to create a Docker version of this project that is not modify and kept to true original. And that is what I have done here with the exception of creating the docker files in this repo.

LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate‚Äîwe just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services. üòä

To help you start with creating a container from this image, you can either use docker-compose or the docker command line. This container image is published on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davisdre/littlelink). 

### docker-compose (recommended)

```
version: "3"
services: 
  little-link:
    image: davisdre/littlelink:latest
    container_name: littlelink-server
    ports: 
      - 80:80
```

### docker commandline

```
docker run -d \
  --name=littlelink-server \
  -p 80:80
  davisdre/littlelink:latest
```
